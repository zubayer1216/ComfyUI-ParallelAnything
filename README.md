# Parallel Anything (True Multi-GPU) for ComfyUI

This suite of nodes unlocks high-performance parallel processing in ComfyUI by utilizing **Model Replication**. Unlike standard offloading which moves a single model instance between devices, these nodes create independent replicas of the model on each selected GPU/CPU, allowing for true simultaneous batch processing.

* **Tested on Z_IMAGE, FLUX.1**

---

## 🚀 Key Features

* **True Parallel Execution**: Simultaneous forward passes on multiple GPUs using thread-safe model replicas
* **Chainable Device Nodes**: Connect multiple `Parallel Device Config` nodes to easily configure 2-8+ GPUs
* **Auto Hardware Detection**: Dropdown menus automatically populated with available CUDA GPUs, CPU, Apple MPS, and Intel XPU
* **Dynamic Load Balancing**: Percentage-based batch splitting (e.g., 70% on RTX 3090, 30% on RTX 3060)
* **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS (MPS)

## 🛠 Nodes Included

### 1. Parallel Anything (True Multi-GPU)
The main orchestration node. It intercepts the diffusion model's forward pass and triggers simultaneous compute kernels across all available replicas.

### 2. Parallel Device Config / List
Allows you to build a `DEVICE_CHAIN`. You can chain multiple GPUs together or use the List node to quickly and their respective workload percentages.

## Requirements

### Hardware
- **Minimum**: 2x GPUs or 1x GPU + CPU (for testing)
- **Recommended**: Identical GPUs for balanced loads
- **VRAM**: Each GPU must independently hold the full model (e.g., SDXL requires ~7GB per GPU)

### Software
- ComfyUI installed and functional
- PyTorch with appropriate backend:

```bash
# CUDA
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121

# Apple Silicon (MPS)
pip install torch torchvision

# Intel XPU (experimental)
pip install intel-extension-for-pytorch

```
---

## 📦 Installation

1.  Navigate to your ComfyUI custom nodes directory:
    ```bash
    cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes/
    ```
2.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/FearL0rd/ComfyUI-ParallelAnything.git
    ```
3.  **Restart ComfyUI.**

## Usage

### Basic 2-GPU Setup

```bash
[Parallel Device Config]                           [Parallel Device Config]
      ↓ cuda:0 (50%)                                     ↓ cuda:1 (50%)
      └──────────────→ [Parallel Anything] ←─────────────┘
                              ↓
                        [Your KSampler/etc]
```

1.  Add Parallel Device Config node → Select cuda:0 from dropdown → Set 50%
2.  Add another Parallel Device Config → Connect DEVICE_CHAIN output from first node → Select cuda:1 → Set 50%
3.  Connect final DEVICE_CHAIN to Parallel Anything node
4.  Connect your MODEL from Load Checkpoint → Parallel Anything → KSampler

### Advanced: 4-GPU Load Balancing
Chain 4 devices with different percentages based on GPU memory:

cuda:0 (RTX 3090): 40%
cuda:1 (RTX 3090): 40%
cuda:2 (V100): 15%
cuda:3 (P100): 5%

### Alternative: Parallel Device List

Use Parallel Device List (1-4x) if you prefer a single node with 4 dropdowns instead of chaining.

### CPU + GPU Hybrid

[Parallel Device Config: cpu (20%)] → [Parallel Device Config: cuda:0 (80%)] → [Parallel Anything]

## Performance Tips

1. PCIe Bandwidth Matters
Ensure GPUs share the same PCIe switch or CPU root complex:
```bash
# Linux: Check PCIe topology
lspci -tv | grep -i nvidia
```
Avoid configurations where GPUs are on separate NUMA nodes with limited inter-socket bandwidth.

2. Batch Size Optimization
* **Minimum:** Batch size ≥ Number of GPUs
* **Sweet Spot:** Batch size 8-16 for 2-4 GPUs
* **Diminishing Returns:** Very large batches may saturate PCIe transfer bandwidth

3. Identical GPUs Preferred
* **Mixing GPU architectures:** (e.g., RTX 4090 + RTX 3090) works but the faster GPU will wait for the slower one at each step. Use percentage weights to compensate (e.g., 60/40 split).

4. Model Placement
Place Parallel Anything immediately before the KSampler, after all LoRA/weight modifications:

```bash
Load Checkpoint → Load LoRA → [Parallel Anything] → KSampler
```

---

## ⚠️ Important Considerations

* **VRAM Usage**: This node uses **Model Replication**. If you use 2 GPUs, you will use 2 times the VRAM (one copy per card).
* **Batch Size**: Parallelism only triggers if your **Batch Size** is > the number of devices in your chain.
* **Inference Tensors**: The node automatically clones and detaches tensors to bypass PyTorch's "Inference tensors do not track version counter" error common in multi-GPU workflows.

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If you encounter a **RuntimeError** regarding "Inference Tensors":
* Ensure you are using a **Batch Size** large enough to split.
* The node uses a "Deep Detach" strategy (`.detach().clone()`) to satisfy the version counter requirements of the KSampler.
* if you see the message "RuntimeError: Expected all tensors to be on the same device, but got mat1 is on cuda:0, different from other tensors on cuda:1 (when checking argument in method wrapper_CUDA_addmm)
" after changing the percentage of the GPU'S for the second run. restart comfyui

### Slower than single GPU
#### Common causes:

* **PCIe Bottleneck:** Data transfer overhead exceeds compute benefit (common with x4/x8 PCIe slots)
* **Small Batch Size:** Overhead of splitting/merging exceeds parallel benefit. Try batch size ≥ 8.
* **Mixed GPUs:** Fast GPU waiting for slow GPU. Adjust percentages.
* **Apple MPS (Mac) Issues**
MPS backend does not support all operations needed for stable diffusion. If you encounter errors:

* Use CPU exclusively on Mac for stability
* MPS support is experimental

### Thread Safety Errors
If you see **CUDA error: invalid device ordinal** or similar:

* Ensure you're not wrapping the model twice (check for nested Parallel Anything nodes)
* Verify all selected devices exist: torch.device('cuda:2') will fail if you only have 2 GPUs (indices 0 and 1)

## Architecture Details

This node implements Data Parallelism via model replication:

1. Replication: On setup, the model state dict is deep-copied to N devices
2. Batch Split: Input batch is divided by percentage weights
3. Thread Pool: Each chunk is processed in parallel using ThreadPoolExecutor
4. Synchronization: torch.cuda.synchronize() ensures computation completes before returning to lead device
5. Concatenation: Results are gathered and concatenated on the lead device
6. Trade-off: Uses N× VRAM for N× throughput (approximately). Best for multi-GPU workstations with identical GPUs.

## Limitations

* ❌ No model parallelism (splitting layers across GPUs) - Each GPU holds full model
* ❌ No gradient synchronization - Inference only (no training/fine-tuning)
* ❌ Static load balancing - Percentages fixed per run, no dynamic adjustment based on queue depth
* ❌ Memory overhead - Briefly uses 2× model memory per GPU during the load_state_dict phase
